# Bookstore-Sales-Software


 A graduate student plans to open a local bookstore near the University of Houston- Downtown campus, with their goal being to offer a diverse collection of academic and non-academic books for students to enjoy in their free time. To bring this goal to life, they require a software system to manage the bookstore’s daily operations efficiently. After reaching out to a small team of developers from their alma mater, they discovered a shared passion for books and comics, as well as a strong nostalgic connection to their own hometown bookstores. Inspired by their peer’s goal, the developers set out to create a management system to support the bookstore’s core operations.
The system will provide an online platform where customers can browse inventory, purchase items, or save books to a wish list for future purchases. Customers will also have the option to preorder books that are out of stock or yet to be released. Additionally, both customers and staff will have user accounts – customers to track orders and manage wish lists, and staff to access inventory and assist with store operations. Managers will have permissions to oversee inventory, track sales, and manage preorders, while administrators, including the owner, will have access to sales records, price adjustments, and tax modifications.  
  The project will deliver a fully functional, web-based application with a user-friendly interface for all roles. It will include a secure database to store user accounts, inventory, sales, and order details, as well as payment integration through third-party gateways. The system will be accessible via desktop and mobile browsers and will incorporate role-based authentication to ensure security. However, it will not include physical store management beyond inventory tracking, nor will it feature book reviews, community engagement, or AI-based recommendations at this stage to maintain focus on core bookstore operations.
  The system's functionality will be organized into three main sections: Sales Management, Product Management, and Record Management. Sales Management will allow users to purchase items, apply coupons and discounts, and manage a subscription list for special offers. Product Management will handle inventory, preorders, and a playlist-style system for organizing book collections. Record Management will enable account creation, sales tracking, and customer service support. These features work together to create an efficient and seamless experience for both customers, staff, and administrators, to ensure smooth bookstore operations.
  By implementing this comprehensive management system, the bookstore will be equipped with the necessary tools to operate efficiently and provide a seamless experience for both customers and staff. The system’s structured approach to sales, product, and record management ensures that inventory is well-maintained, transactions are securely processed, and users can easily navigate the platform. By prioritizing core functionalities, this project will help bring the graduate student’s vision to life, fostering a strong literary community near the University of Houston – Downtown campus.
